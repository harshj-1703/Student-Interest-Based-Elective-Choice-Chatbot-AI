two types of keywords :-
1.)Sentimental => meaning matching
2.)Laxical => word to word matching

KeyBERT is a minimal and easy-to-use keyword extraction technique that 
leverages BERT embeddings to create keywords and keyphrases that are most similar to a document.

BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is an open source 
machine learning framework for natural language processing (NLP).
It was invented to help computers understand the ambiguous meanings in text or the masked word in search queries.

# The diversity of the results between 0 and 1 if use_mmr is set to True.(diversity means different between words)
# use_mmr is for Whether to use Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) for the selection of keywords/keyphrases.
	(Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) is a ranking algorithm that has been widely used for subset selection.)
